# Quran-Analysis-and-Visualization

The Quran is a scripture that acts as the main reference book for more than 1.6
billion of Muslims all around the world. It covers information from politics to science, with vast amount of information that requires effort to uncover the knowledge behind it. In this project I have tried to clean the dataset and tried to visualize the data present in the Holy Quran. 

2 Datasets were used here: [the_holy_Quran](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/the-holy-quran) and [quran_makki_madani](https://www.kaggle.com/abdulbaqi/quran-makki-madani)
